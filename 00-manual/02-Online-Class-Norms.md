# Online Class Norms

## Workspace Environment

- Find the most quiet, distraction-free area in your home to begin class.
- A second monitor is recommended; however, it is not a barrier for either this course or career.

## Attendance and Timeliness

- The Zoom link will become active at the start of _optional_ office hours.
- Class instruction will begin on time or within a minute or two of the scheduled start time.
- Students who arrive more than 45 minutes after the start of class, or leave more than 45 minutes before the end of class will be marked absent.
- If you are late or absent, video recordings of class will be posted in BCS the day after class for your review.
- Remember to mark your attendance in BCS when you log into Zoom.
- In the unlikely event that you forget to sign in the TAs are able to correct the oversight; however, once the day ends you must send an email to your TA and SSM.

## Zoom and Screenshare

- Everyone’s video should **always** be on during class! _(Video can be turned off during breaks/lunch)_
- You can use Zoom’s “Virtual Background” feature to mask visual background distractions.
- Share your screen during in-class activities.
- If you need an exception to the above policy, please contact the instructor directly via Slack.

## Questions and Classroom Interaction

- All questions are important and valid, but not all questions are attached to that day's objectives.
- If you have a question related to the lecture, please raise your hand in Zoom participants tab.
- When called upon, unmute your mic and ask.
- You can also use Slack **#02-ask-the-class** to ask questions not directly related to the topic at hand.
- If the instructor feels the question is not best addressed right then, he may ask you to direct it to slack for later attention.
- Outside of class and after hours, you should utilize the **#02-ask-the-class** channel to receive assistance from your classmates.

## Office Hours

- Office hours are optional and available for you to get personalized assistance from the instructional staff. Take advantage of this.
- Use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/byron-ku/office-hours-with-ta) to schedule a 15 minute time block with a TA

* Additionally, scheduled activities in the main room may include:
  - Review sessions
  - Extra-curricular sessions
  - AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions

## Feedback

- This course utilizes several feedback methods. The include, but are not limited to:
  - "Fist-to-Five" polls (in Zoom)
  - Weekly feedback
  - Randomized questions.

## Homework

- Homework is graded by the Centralized Grading Team. It is your responsibility to watch BCS for any `Incomplete` assignments. These cannot be graded and count against your graduation requirements.
- In the event that you receive an `Incomplete`, you may request a homework regrade by re-submitting the assignment and alerting a TA.
