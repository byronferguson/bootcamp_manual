# Getting Help

Knowing how to get help is essential. Not just as a bootcamp student, but as a professional. Below are a few resources, some specifically for your bootcamp.

## Getting Help during a Breakout Session

To get help in class during a breakout session, i.e. class activities, Click "Ask for Help" button in the meeting controls. The first available member of the instructional staff will be there to help you.

## Getting Help outside of Class

The instructional staff is not available outside of regular class hours. To receive help outside of these hours, you should be aware of the following avenues.

### Ask the Class

The Slack channel `#02-ask-the-class` is provided for you as resources to ask your fellow classmates for assistance. Oftentimes, simply taking the time to write out your question helps you find your error. This is part of rubber-duck debugging. https://rubberduckdebugging.com/

### Tutoring Sessions

As part of your program fees, a tutor is available to you at no additional cost. To register for a tutor, please sign in the BCS, select "Support" from the nav menu, and select "Tutor Request" from the "QUESTION CATEGORY" dropdown menu.

## Overall Principles

1. _Read AND Google the error message first._ Most error messages have already been solved on the internet. Search for it!
1. _Include your code._ A snippet of the code or a link to the GitHub repo is helpful. _(Use triple backtick code-block formatting in Slack ``` around your code snippet)_
1. _Be specific._ Saying, "I have an error" isn't helpful. Copy/pasting the exact error text and/or providing a screenshot _is_.
1. _Include a screenshot._ Sometimes, seeing the issue in context helps us solve the problem.
1. _Include a screencast._ If the bug is an issue that only occurs when you interact with a page, it may be helpful to record a video of that interaction.
