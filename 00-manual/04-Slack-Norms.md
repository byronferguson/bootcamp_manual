# Slack Norms

## How to Use Slack

Slack is a tool just like any other. The more you use it, the better you will become. You ability to use the tools common to the industry is also important.

If you are not familiar with slack, I encourage you to watch this short video: https://youtu.be/b_biMJibhl8

## Slack Channels and Their Purpose

- `#01-live-tth` - Class work (discussion about class activities both during and outside of class time)
- `#02-ask-the-class` - Ask your fellow classmates a question. Great for after-hours. May not be monitored by Instructional Staff (but usually is).
- `#03-resources` - Resources to help you on your way. This is probably the best channel for you to keep up with the class materials. Resources are posted at least once for every class and sometimes other resources become available.
- `#04-shout-outs` - Channel for sharing compliments and praise for your fellow students when they've helped you or the group. It feels good to be recognized.
- `#coding-boot-camp` - This channel is for working on a project. Hold meetings, share docs, and make decisions together with your team. _(Unused)_
- `#general` - Automated announcements when the class repo is updated
- `#random` - This channel is for... well, everything else. It’s a place for team jokes, spur-of-the-moment ideas, and funny GIFs. Go wild!
- `#study-groups` - For making study groups with your classmates. _(Unused)_

Inappropriate language can include any language that in any way looks like, sounds like, or abbreviates any of the following: profanity, sexual content, or explicit language, or harassment.

This Channel is not for:

A good rule of thumb here is if you don’t have anything nice to say, then please, don’t say anything at all.
