# Breakout Room Norms

## Structure and Grouping

Breakout rooms will be organized in several different ways, depending on the activity:

- Randomly assigned groups of 2, 3, or 4.
- Self-assigned rooms based on your present confidence
  - `Advice` - Peer-programming with nudges from Instructor/TA
  - `Assist` - Peer-programming with prompted steps from Instructor/TA
- During office hours you may request a breakout room to work with other students.

## Expectations

1. First, select someone to share their screen. This person will be the “coder” for this activity.
1. Second, make sure everyone in the group understands the activity’s instructions.
1. Other group members will “Pair Program” by giving verbal guidance to the “coder”.
1. The “coder” will not necessarily drive the activity. Instead they will rely on guidance from the others in the group to complete the task. The “coder” can initiate writing code independently after verbally explaining their intentions to the rest of the group.
1. Instructional staff will bounce from between breakout rooms to check progress, answer questions, and offer guidance.
1. If additional help is required, please request assistance via the Request Help button in your breakout room
   - If no one comes in a timely manner also reach out on **`#01-live-tth`** slack channel.
