# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Typing Speed

Improving your typing speed is eential to being a good data professional.

Some resources to consider:

### Nitro Type - https://www.nitrotype.com/

Fun, race car themed application to test your typing speed.

### Keybr - https://www.keybr.com/

Site designed to teach you "touch typing." No more "hunt-and-peck."

### typing.io - https://typing.io/

The keys you use for coding are often different the keys commonly used when typing English. Your English typing speed typically drops by 30% when typing code. Get practice with specific syntax here. I recommend the JavaScript jQuery track.
